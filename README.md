# Discord-Chat-Analyzer

I want to analyze the discord server I share with my friends. It will allow me to learn pandas and how to manipulate data, and will also be a fun take to analyze the texting patterns of my friends. I used [DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter) to download the messages from my server
